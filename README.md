# Web-Development E-commerce Project

## This is an e-commerce website project on Spring and Hibernate using Tomcat as an application server and MySQL as the database
### To set it up the project follow the following steps:
### in Hibernate.cfg:
- create a Schema in MySQL with the name final_project (You can change this to something else by modifying the hibernate.cfg file)
- hibernate.connection.username>Enter authorized username of the database here<
- hibernate.connection.password>Enter password of the authorized username of the database here<
### in PublicViewController look for the following comment and change the email address and password of the account which will send successful registration emails
//-------------------------------EMAIL------------------

### in ProductController
set the value of "String path" here with a folder which exists. This is where the images will be stored.

## Here are a few screenshots of the web pages. Due to shortage of time the front end hasn't been worked on much.
